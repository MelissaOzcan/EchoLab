# EchoLab

## Background
EchoLab is a web application designed to revolutionize the way developers, students, and educators collaborate on programming projects. Unlike traditional online code compilers, EchoLab introduces the concept of "rooms" â€“ collaborative spaces where users can choose from five major programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Node.js, Rust) to write and execute code in real-time. This feature fosters a community-centric approach to coding, allowing users to collaborate seamlessly. With support for multiple languages EchoLab is versatile. Participants in a room can write, share, and run code in real-time, providing an interactive coding environment that is perfect for peer programming, tutoring, or collaborative projects. A standout feature is the built-in voice call functionality within each room. This allows for real-time voice communication among participants, enhancing collaboration and making it easier to discuss ideas, troubleshoot code, and teach programming concepts. Teachers can leverage EchoLab to create a virtual classroom, where they can code live, demonstrate programming concepts, and provide immediate feedback to students, all while engaging in voice discussions.

By combining coding with voice communication, EchoLab offers an immersive learning experience that mimics in-person collaboration, making it especially beneficial for remote education. Whether for professional development teams, student projects, or coding bootcamps, EchoLab streamlines the process of working together on code, reducing barriers to effective collaboration. Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, it breaks down geographical barriers, enabling global collaboration and learning opportunities.
